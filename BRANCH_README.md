# Work Branch Overview

This branch consolidates namespace changes and adds documentation for the proposed Unified GameData system.

## Key Updates
- Refactored all namespaces to use the simplified `Lineage` root.
- Fixed ambiguous references between `Database.Entity` and `Entities.Entity` in the game systems.
- Added documentation under `Documents/02_Tasks/UnifiedGameData` detailing the GameData hierarchy, integration notes, and an implementation task list.

Future work will focus on implementing the GameData system and updating existing gameplay scripts to source their static data from it.
