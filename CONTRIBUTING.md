# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in helping with *Lineage: Ancestral Legacies*! This project follows a simple workflow to keep the history tidy and collaboration smooth.

## Workflow

1. **Branching**: Create feature branches from `main` using a descriptive name such as `feature/camera-zoom` or `bugfix/navmesh`.
2. **Commit messages**: Use short presentâ€‘tense summaries (e.g. `Add zoom controls`). Group related changes in a single commit when possible.
3. **Pull requests**: Open a pull request describing the changes and reference related documents or issues. After review, merge back to `main`.

## Code Style

- Follow the existing C# conventions used in `Assets/Scripts`.
- Keep documentation in Markdown (`.md`) where possible and place new docs inside the appropriate folder under `Documents/`.
- Before committing, ensure the project opens in Unity without errors.

Happy coding!
