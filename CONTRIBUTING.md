# Contributing to Lineage: Ancestral Legacies

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Lineage: Ancestral Legacies! Your help is appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from reporting bugs to suggesting new features, writing code, or improving documentation.

### Reporting Bugs
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- For Unity-specific bugs, please include Unity version, relevant console logs, and steps to reproduce.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open a new issue with a clear title and description of the suggested enhancement.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most users and provide step-by-step instructions on how it might be used.

### Code Contributions
- **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
- **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Lineage-Ancestral-Legacies.git`
- **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/issue-number`.
- **Make your changes.** Adhere to the project's coding style and conventions (see Naming Conventions and Assembly Dependencies in the main `README.md`).
- **Test your changes** thoroughly.
- **Commit your changes:** `git commit -m "feat: Add some feature"` or `fix: Resolve an issue`. (Follow conventional commit messages if possible).
- **Push to your fork:** `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
- **Open a pull request** to the main repository. Provide a clear description of the changes.

## Coding Conventions
- Follow the Naming Conventions and Assembly Dependencies outlined in the main `README.md`.
- Write clear, understandable, and maintainable code.
- Comment code where necessary, especially for complex logic.

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Questions?
If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue and tag it as a "question".
