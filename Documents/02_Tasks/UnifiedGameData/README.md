# Unified GameData System Documentation

This folder collects planning and implementation notes for the **Unified GameData System** used by *Lineage: Ancestral Legacies*. The goal is to maintain a single hierarchical data structure (`global.GameData`) that provides all static definitions for entities, items, recipes, spawning rules and more.

The design is described in detail in `Documents/01_Design/Unified GameData System.md`. The documents here distill that concept into actionable tasks and quick references for everyday development.

## Folder Contents

- `task_list.md` – checklist for building and integrating the GameData system
- `data_structure_overview.md` – reference of the planned `GameData` hierarchy
- `integration_notes.md` – guidance on using GameData across systems

Additional files may be added as the system evolves.
