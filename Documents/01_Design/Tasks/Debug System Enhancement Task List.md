In-Depth Debug System Plan for Unity
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a powerful debugging system for Lineages: Ancestral Legacies. The goal is to create a suite of tools that facilitate rapid testing, issue identification, and system analysis both during development and for specific testing builds.

1. Goals of a Robust Debug System
Accelerate Development: Quickly test new features, game balance, and specific scenarios without playing through entire sections of the game.

Efficient Bug Squashing: Provide tools to easily reproduce, isolate, and understand the root cause of bugs.

System Insight: Offer ways to visualize and inspect the internal state of various game systems at runtime.

Performance Analysis: Integrate with or complement tools for identifying performance bottlenecks.

Maintainability: Ensure debug code is well-organized, minimally impacts release builds, and is easy to extend.

2. Core Components of the Debug System
A. Advanced Logging System
Levels: Implement log levels (e.g., Verbose, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical).

Categories/Tags: Allow logs to be tagged by system (e.g., "AI", "Inventory", "Quest", "Combat") for easy filtering.

Output Options:

Unity Console (default).

In-Game Console (see below).

Persistent Log Files (for post-session analysis or bug reports from testers).

Contextual Information: Automatically include timestamps, frame numbers, and potentially call stacks for errors.

Implementation: Can leverage Unity's Debug.Log, UnityEngine.ILogger, or a more advanced third-party logging library (e.g., NLog, Serilog if you're feeling ambitious, though often overkill for Unity unless you have very specific needs).

B. In-Game Debug Console
UI: A toggleable overlay (e.g., opened with a hotkey like backtick ~ or F1).

Log Display: Shows filtered and color-coded logs from the Advanced Logging System.

Command Input: A text field for typing and executing debug commands.

Features:

Scrollable log history.

Log filtering by level/category.

Command history (up/down arrows).

Command auto-completion (optional, advanced).

Copy log messages to clipboard.

C. Debug Display & Overlays (Heads-Up Debug - HUD)
Real-time Info: On-screen display of critical runtime data.

FPS counter, Frame time (ms).

Memory usage (Total, Mono).

Object counts (e.g., active enemies, dynamic entities).

Player coordinates, current scene name.

Specific game state variables (e.g., current quest objective, player gold).

Visualizers: Drawing debug information directly in the game view.

Bounding boxes for colliders/triggers.

AI pathfinding lines, vision cones, aggro radii.

Spawn point locations.

Grid overlays for tile-based systems.

Custom visualizations for game-specific mechanics.

Toggleable: Allow individual overlays or groups of overlays to be turned on/off.

D. Command System Architecture
Command Registration: A centralized system where different parts of your game can register new debug commands.

Command Parsing: Handle command names and arguments (integers, floats, strings, booleans, target object selectors).

Reflection (Optional but Powerful): Use C# reflection to automatically discover methods marked with a custom attribute (e.g., [DebugCommand("command_name", "description")]) and make them available in the console.

Feedback: Commands should provide feedback to the console (e.g., "Item 'X' spawned," "Error: Player not found").

E. Runtime Inspectors & Watchers
Object Inspector: A tool (possibly integrated into the console or a separate UI) to select a GameObject at runtime and view/modify its component properties (similar to Unity's Inspector, but in-game). This is advanced but incredibly useful.

Variable Watcher: A UI panel where you can "watch" the value of specific static variables or properties of key singleton objects in real-time.

F. Event Tracing/Recording (Advanced)
Event Log: Record significant game events (e.g., quest started/completed, item acquired, enemy killed, level loaded) to a buffer or file.

Playback/Analysis: Useful for understanding sequences of events leading to a bug, especially for hard-to-reproduce issues.

G. Build Configuration & Conditional Compilation
DEVELOPMENT_BUILD flag: Unity automatically defines this for development builds. Use it to wrap debug-specific code:

#if DEVELOPMENT_BUILD || UNITY_EDITOR
// Debug code here
#endif

Custom Scripting Define Symbols: Define your own symbols (e.g., ENABLE_DEBUG_CONSOLE, ENABLE_VISUALIZERS) in Player Settings to control which debug features are compiled into specific builds. This gives finer-grained control than just DEVELOPMENT_BUILD.

3. In-Game Debugging Methods & Examples
A. Console Commands
General:

help: List available commands.

help <command_name>: Show details for a specific command.

clear: Clear the console log.

quit: Quit the game.

scene_load <scene_name>: Load a specific scene.

echo <message>: Print a message to the console.

Player/Unit Specific:

god_mode [true/false]: Toggle invincibility for the player or selected unit.

noclip [true/false]: Toggle collision passthrough.

teleport <x> <y> <z> or teleport <target_object_name>: Move player/selected unit.

set_stat <stat_name> <value> [target_unit_id]: Modify a stat (e.g., set_stat health 999 player).

give_item <item_id> [amount] [target_inventory_id]: Add an item (using Item_SO.itemID).

remove_item <item_id> [amount] [target_inventory_id].

learn_ability <ability_id> [target_unit_id].

World & Entity Manipulation:

spawn_enemy <enemy_id> [amount] [x] [y] [z]: Spawn enemies (using Enemy_SO.enemyID).

kill_all_enemies [type_tag].

toggle_ai [true/false] [target_group_tag]: Enable/disable AI for all or specific entities.

set_time_scale <scale>: Change game speed (e.g., 0.5 for slow-mo, 2.0 for fast-forward).

set_world_time <hour> <minute>: If your game has a day/night cycle.

Quest & Event Debugging:

quest_start <quest_id>.

quest_complete_step <quest_id> <step_index>.

quest_set_objective_status <quest_id> <objective_id> <status>.

trigger_event <event_name>.

System Toggles:

toggle_debug_overlay <overlay_name> [true/false].

log_level <level_name>: Change runtime logging verbosity.

B. Visual Debuggers
Use Debug.DrawLine, Debug.DrawRay, Gizmos.DrawWireSphere, Gizmos.DrawCube, etc., within OnDrawGizmos() (for editor view) or custom drawing logic for in-game overlays (often using GL class or a dedicated debug drawing library).

Ensure these can be toggled on/off via console commands or a debug menu to avoid clutter.

C. Debug Menus
For complex systems, a dedicated IMGUI (Immediate Mode GUI) or UI Toolkit based menu can be more user-friendly than just console commands.

Inventory Debug Menu: View all items, add/remove items, change quantities.

Quest Debug Menu: List all quests, view their current state, advance/reset quests.

Faction Debug Menu: View faction standings, modify reputations.

4. Out-of-Game Debugging Methods
A. Unity Profiler (Window > Analysis > Profiler)
CPU Usage: Identify scripts and methods consuming the most CPU time.

GPU Usage: Analyze rendering performance (draw calls, setpass calls, shader complexity). (Less critical for 2D top-down, but still useful).

Memory Profiler: Track memory allocations, identify memory leaks, see asset memory usage. (Use the separate Memory Profiler package for more detail).

Audio Profiler: Debug audio sources, voices, and memory.

Physics Profiler: Analyze performance of 2D/3D physics.

Deep Profiling: Profiles every C# method call. High overhead, but very detailed.

B. Unity Frame Debugger (Window > Analysis > Frame Debugger)
Capture a single frame and step through all the draw calls used to render it.

Excellent for understanding rendering order, shader issues, and why something might not be appearing correctly.

C. External Log Files
Configure your logging system to write to files, especially for builds sent to testers.

Include system information (OS, hardware) at the start of the log file.

Use a log viewer tool for easier analysis of large log files.

D. Crash Reporting
Unity Cloud Diagnostics: Can automatically collect crash reports from users if you use Unity services.

Third-party Services: Sentry, Bugsnag, etc., offer more advanced crash reporting and analytics.

Custom Solution: For critical errors, you could try to catch unhandled exceptions and write crash information (stack trace, basic system info, recent log buffer) to a local file.

E. Unit & Integration Testing
Unit Tests (Edit Mode Tests): Test individual methods and classes (especially pure C# logic like in your ScriptableObjects or utility classes) in isolation without running the full game.

Integration Tests (Play Mode Tests): Test how different systems interact with each other while the game is running in a controlled environment.

Unity Test Framework (Window > General > Test Runner) provides tools for writing and running these tests.

6. Best Practices for Debug Code
Separation of Concerns: Keep debug logic as separate as possible from core game logic.

Use partial classes if debug methods are extensive within a game class.

Use extension methods to add debug functionalities to existing classes.

Create dedicated debug components that can be added to GameObjects.

Conditional Compilation is Key: Use #if UNITY_EDITOR || DEVELOPMENT_BUILD (or your custom defines) religiously to ensure debug code does not ship in release builds or impact their performance.

Performance Awareness: Be mindful that some debug tools (especially visualizers drawing many elements every frame or heavy reflection) can impact editor/development build performance. Make them toggleable.

Clear Naming: Use clear names for debug commands and variables (e.g., debug_ToggleGodMode or m_EnableAIDebugOverlay).

Documentation: Document your debug commands (the help command is good for this) and how to use the various debug tools, especially if working in a team.

Accessibility: Make debug tools easy to access (e.g., consistent hotkeys, clear menu paths).

Non-Destructive by Default: Debug tools shouldn't corrupt save data or permanently alter game state unless explicitly designed to do so (and clearly communicated).

This plan is quite extensive, Remember to implement it iteratively. Start with the foundational pieces (logging, basic console, a few commands) and expand as your game grows and specific debugging needs arise. A good debug system evolves with the game.
