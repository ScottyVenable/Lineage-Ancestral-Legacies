# Camera Panning Performance Tuning Guide

## ‚úÖ **New Serializable Fields Added**

Your CameraManager now has improved performance tuning options available in the Unity Inspector:

### **Mouse Panning Settings:**

1. **Mouse Pan Sensitivity** (0.1 - 5.0)
   - Controls how sensitive the mouse movement is
   - Higher = more movement per mouse pixel
   - Default: 1.0

2. **Mouse Pan Speed** (0.1 - 10.0)
   - Base speed multiplier for mouse panning
   - Higher = faster panning
   - Default: 1.0

3. **Mouse Pan Responsiveness** (1.0 - 20.0) ‚≠ê **NEW**
   - How quickly the camera responds to mouse input
   - Higher = more immediate response
   - Default: 5.0

4. **Immediate Stop On Mouse Release** ‚≠ê **NEW**
   - ‚úÖ Enabled: Camera stops moving immediately when you release the mouse
   - ‚ùå Disabled: Camera continues smooth movement to target position
   - Default: Enabled (true)

## üéÆ **Quick Presets**

Right-click on the CameraManager component in the Inspector to access these presets:

### **Fast Panning Preset**
- Best for: Real-time strategy games, fast-paced gameplay
- Settings: High speed, high responsiveness, immediate stop, no smoothing

### **Smooth Panning Preset** 
- Best for: Cinematic games, exploration games
- Settings: Moderate speed, lower responsiveness, smooth movement, no immediate stop

### **Responsive Panning Preset** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- Best for: Most games, balanced feel
- Settings: Good speed, high responsiveness, immediate stop, minimal smoothing

## üîß **Manual Tuning Tips**

### **For Faster Panning:**
1. Increase `Mouse Pan Speed` (try 2.0-3.0)
2. Increase `Mouse Pan Responsiveness` (try 8.0-15.0)
3. Enable `Immediate Stop On Mouse Release`
4. Disable `Smooth Movement` OR set `Smooth Time` to 0.1

### **For Smoother Panning:**
1. Lower `Mouse Pan Responsiveness` (try 2.0-4.0)
2. Enable `Smooth Movement`
3. Increase `Smooth Time` (try 0.3-0.5)
4. Disable `Immediate Stop On Mouse Release`

### **For More Responsive Feel:**
1. Increase `Mouse Pan Responsiveness` (try 7.0-12.0)
2. Enable `Immediate Stop On Mouse Release`
3. Set `Smooth Time` to 0.1 or lower

## üß™ **Testing Your Settings**

1. **Start Play Mode** in Unity
2. **Test middle mouse panning** in the Game view
3. **Adjust settings** in real-time in the Inspector
4. **Use the presets** as starting points for fine-tuning

## üìù **Technical Notes**

- **Responsiveness** is multiplied with `Time.deltaTime` for frame-rate independent movement
- **Immediate Stop** works by setting the target position to the current camera position when mouse is released
- **All settings are serializable** - they save with your scene/prefab
- **Context menu presets** can be accessed by right-clicking the component

## üéØ **Recommended Starting Values**

For most games, try these values:
```
Mouse Pan Speed: 1.5
Mouse Pan Sensitivity: 1.5  
Mouse Pan Responsiveness: 7.0
Immediate Stop On Mouse Release: ‚úÖ True
Smooth Movement: ‚úÖ True
Smooth Time: 0.1
```
