# Developer Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the project! This short guide explains how to set up the Unity environment and points you to key resources in the repository.

## Unity Setup

1. Install the Unity version listed in `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`.
2. Use Unity Hub to add the project by selecting the repository folder.
3. After Unity finishes importing, open the `Lineage` scene or any sample scene to confirm the project loads correctly.

## Where to Find Information

- **Design documents** – `Documents/01_Design`
- **Research** – `Documents/03_Research`
- **Guides and how‑tos** – `Documents/04_Guides`

These folders contain gameplay concepts, system plans and practical setup guides.

## Next Steps

Familiarize yourself with the `Assets` directory and explore the scripts and StudioTools infrastructure. When you are ready to contribute, read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the workflow.
