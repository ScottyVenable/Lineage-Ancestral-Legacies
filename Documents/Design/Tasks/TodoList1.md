# TODO
1. Make it an option to follow a single pop with a keypress or UI button press.
2. Implement the Forage and Hauling system.
3. I noticed the camera controller takes a CineCamera. I was wondering the difference between that camera and a regular camera and how I would go up setting a CineCamera for 2D rendering of the game.
